      <h1>odgi: Optimized Dynamic (genome) Graph Interface</h1>
      <h3>working with really big variation graphs</h3>
      <p>
      <strong><a href="https://github.com/vgteam/odgi">odgi</a></strong> provides tools for the in-memory manipulation of <a href="https://github.com/vgteam/vg">variation graphs</a>.
      Representing large genomic graphs with minimal memory overhead requires a careful encoding of the graph entities.
      It is possible to build succinct, static data structures to store queryable graphs, as in <a href="#xg">xg</a>, but dynamic data structures are more tricky to implement.

      <h3>Data structure</h3>
      <strong>odgi</strong> follows the dynamic <a href="https://github.com/jltsiren/gbwt">GWBT</a> in developing a byte-packed version of the graph and paths through it.
      Each node is represented by a byte array into which we write variable length integers to represent
      <ol>
        <li>the node sequence</li>
        <li>its edges</li>
        <li>the paths crossing the node.</li>
      </ol>
      The edges and path steps are recorded relativistically, as deltas between the current node id and the target node id, where the node id corresponds to the rank in the global array of nodes.
      Graphs built from biological data sets tend to have local partial order, and when sorted the stored deltas will tend to be small.
      This allows them to be compressed with a variable length integer representation, resulting in a small in-memory footprint in exchange for the cost of packing and unpacking.
      <p>
      The savings are substantial.
      In partially ordered regions of the graph, most deltas will require only a single byte.
      The resulting implementation is able to load the whole genome 1000 Genomes Project graph (described in the publication on vg in Nature Biotechnology) in around 20GB of RAM.
      
      Initially, <strong>odgi</strong> has been developed to allow in-memory manipulation of graphs produced by the <a href="https://github.com/ekg/seqwish">seqwish</a> variation graph inducer.

      <h3>Python bindings</h3>
      In order to ease the development of tools building on top of <strong>odgi</strong>, <a href="https://github.com/vgteam/odgi/blob/master/src/pythonmodule.cpp">Python bindings</a> via <a href="https://github.com/pybind/pybind11">pybind11</a> have been implemented.
      Detailed documentation of the bindings are given in <a href="odgipy.html">odgipy</a>, and usage examples can be found in a corresponding <a href="https://odgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst/tutorial.html">tutorial</a>.

      <h3>Documentation</h3>
      The <a href="odgi_docs.html">odgi docs</a> provide detailed information about the command line API, including descriptions of each subcommand and their invocation syntax.
